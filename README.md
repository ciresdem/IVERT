# IVERT
**ICESat-2 Validation of Elevations Reporting Tool**

IVERT validates Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) by comparing their elevations against ICESat-2 satellite photon data. It supports topographic, bathymetric, and mixed coastal DEMs, runs fully offline on any machine, and handles vertical datum conversions automatically.

Developed by the [CIRES Coastal DEM Team](https://ciresdem.github.io). Primary authors: [Mike MacFerrin](https://github.com/mmacferrin) (IVERT) and [Matthew Love](https://github.com/matth-love) ([continuous-dems](https://github.com/continuous-dems) utilities).

## Capabilities

- Validate topographic, bathymetric, and coastal DEMs against ICESat-2 ATL03/ATL24 photons
- Automatic vertical datum conversion (NAVD88, EGM2008, MLLW, and many more)
- Configurable photon confidence and quality filtering
- Statistical outputs: bias, RMSE, NMAD, per-cell error maps
- Export errors to GeoTIFF, GeoPackage, Shapefile, or XYZ text
- Local photon database management — download once, validate many times

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install ivert
```

For development (editable install from this repo):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciresdem/IVERT.git
cd IVERT
pip install -e .
```

Three dependencies — `fetchez`, `globato`, and `transformez` — are pulled automatically from the [continuous-dems](https://github.com/continuous-dems) GitHub organization and do not need to be installed separately.

## Quick start

**1. Download ICESat-2 photon data for your area** (bounding box in W/E/S/N order):

```bash
ivert database download -74.0/-73.0/40.5/41.0
```

**2. Validate your DEM:**

```bash
ivert validate mydem.tif
```

**3. Check the output directory** for `mydem_results.h5`, a validation plot (`.png`), and error exports (`.tif`, `.gpkg`).
