# IVERT
The ICESat-2 Validation of Elevations Reporting Tool

This code is currently in active development by the CIRES Coastal DEM Team. Primary authors are [Mike MacFerrin](https://github.com/mmacferrin) (developing the IVERT code) and [Matthew Love](https://github.com/matth-love) (developing the [CUDEM](https://github.com/ciresdem/cudem) modules underpinning various aspects of IVERT's functionality). Some modules may have broken dependencies or other shortfalls, bugs are being worked out as we migrate to a cloud computing environment. The code is still in beta development, but new releases (v0.6.0 and beyond) will enable offline execution by anyone with (or without) cloud credentials.

This document will be updated significantly when the newest IVERT version (0.6.0) is released with these capabilities.
